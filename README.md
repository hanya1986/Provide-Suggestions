# Provide-Suggestions
This is a C# Console app project for windows.There are two versions of the code. Either with 3 party API or without. 
You can run the code directly if you want to run without API version.

If you want to run the API version than you need to do the following.
	1. You need to go to "https://www.yelp.com/developers/" to get registered.
	2. After registration get a API key from that website.
	3. Once you have the key, Open the ConfigFileForYelpAPI.cs and set the key up.
  4. Rebuild the solution, and good to go.
